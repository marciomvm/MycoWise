A luxurious risotto that perfectly showcases the delicate flavor of Lion's Mane mushrooms.

## Ingredients

- 300g Arborio rice
- 250g Lion's Mane mushroom, torn into small pieces
- 6 cups vegetable broth, kept warm
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup white wine
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat vegetable broth and keep warm.

2. In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until golden (about 5 minutes). Remove and set aside.

3. In the same pan, add butter and sauté onion until translucent (about 5 minutes).

4. Add garlic and rice, cook for 2 minutes until rice is lightly toasted.

5. Add wine and stir until absorbed.

6. Begin adding warm broth one ladle at a time, stirring constantly. Wait for each addition to be absorbed before adding more.

7. After about 18-20 minutes, when rice is creamy but still al dente, stir in the cooked mushrooms.

8. Remove from heat, stir in Parmesan cheese and thyme.

9. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

10. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

## Tips

- Keep the broth warm throughout cooking
- Stir constantly for the creamiest texture
